Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners. And itcametopass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.
And they cried unto us, saying, Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.
And itcametopass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.
And itcametopass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them. And itcametopass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us.
And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.
And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.
