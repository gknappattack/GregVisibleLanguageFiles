            <h2>Book of Mormon Tree Chart Help Page</h2>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
           <p>The Book of Mormon Tree graph is divided into three layers which can be navigated by the user</p>
           <p>The three layers are as follows from most general to specific: <br><br>
            - Word Type: The entirety of the data set is on display, with highlight colors distinguishing the function words from content words. This provides a 
            large scale overview of the prominence of function vs. content words for the current data set.<br><br>
            - Part of Speech: Within each set of either content or function words, the next layer breaks down either set by part of speech. This gives a better picture what exact type 
            of words are most common within the data set, giving a more detailed picture.<br><br>
            - Individual Words: Within each break down of a set of part of speech words, individual words can be selected and explored. Hovering individual words will give the frequency value and 
        other details of interest. This is the most specific layer of the chart.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Changing Datasets</h3>
            <p>
                Each Bubble Chart is created from data for a single speaker from the Book of Mormon text. The sidebar on the right contains the name of 
                each speaker. In order to view the charts for a specific person, the user can click on the name and the graphs will automatically be redrawn.
                The currently selected dataset/speaker will be highlighted in bold text for clarity.
            </p>
            <h3>Chart Interaction</h3>
            <p>While viewing the chart, has a few options for interacting with the graph. If a section of the chart is hovered with the cursor, the exact 
                frequency value of the word (how many times it appears in the text) will be displayed. <br><br>
                If a section is clicked, the graph will "drill-down" on the selected section, redrawing itself to fill the chart display area with only 
                the selected data. (Ex. If the 'Content Word' half of the chart is selected from the inital display, the function words half will vanish and 
                the content word half will expand and reveal the breakdown by part of speech.)

    <h3>Filter Controls</h3>
            <p>The drop down menu and text entry field to the left of the chart type buttons are the filter controls<br>
            <br>There are two options for filtering the data set.</p>
            <p>1) Filter by number of words: Parse the list down to a limited number of entries to make a larger data set smaller.
                The user can enter an integer greater than 0 into the text field and select the go button, and the current chart will be re-drawn with the number of bubbles selected.
                If a number that is greater than the total bubbles in the data set or less than or equal to 0 is entered, the full data set will be displayed<br>
                Note: Filtering is done from largest to smallest. If 2 bubbles are selected from a total data set of 10, the two with the highest frequency values will be displayed.
                <br><br>
                2) Filtering by part of speech: Within each graph type, a single part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) can be isolated and drawn as a graph.
                The user simply needs to select a part of speech from the drop down menu and select the go button and the graph will be redrawn showing only words of that part of speech.
                Note: Given the graphs are divided into content and function words, if a part of speech that is not present in the current graph is selected, there will be no effect on the graph. 
                (Ex. If filtering to display only nouns is selected while the function words are displayed, no change will occur. When the content graph is opened again, the filter will be applied.)
