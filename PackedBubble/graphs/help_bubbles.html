            <h2>Book of Mormon Packed Bubble Chart Help Page</h2>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
           <p>Click on one of the three Chart Type buttons at the bottom of the page to begin.</p>
           <p>The three chart types are as follows: <br><br>
            - Content Words: Words such as nouns and verbs that describe what is happening or what is involved in a sentence.<br>
            - Function Words: Words such as articles and prepositions that help build the mechanical structure of a sentence.<br>
            - Theme Words: A chart consisting of both content and function words that are sorted by the thematic nature of the in-text context</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Filter Controls</h3>
            <p>The drop down menu and text entry field to the left of the chart type buttons are the filter controls<br>
            <br>There are two options for filtering the data set.</p>
            <p>1) Filter by number of words: Parse the list down to a limited number of entries to make a larger data set smaller.
                The user can enter an integer greater than 0 into the text field and select the go button, and the current chart will be re-drawn with the number of bubbles selected.
                If a number that is greater than the total bubbles in the data set or less than or equal to 0 is entered, the full data set will be displayed<br>
                Note: Filtering is done from largest to smallest. If 2 bubbles are selected from a total data set of 10, the two with the highest frequency values will be displayed.
                <br><br>
                2) Filtering by part of speech: Within each graph type, a single part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) can be isolated and drawn as a graph.
                The user simply needs to select a part of speech from the drop down menu and select the go button and the graph will be redrawn showing only words of that part of speech.
                Note: Given the graphs are divided into content and function words, if a part of speech that is not present in the current graph is selected, there will be no effect on the graph. 
                (Ex. If filtering to display only nouns is selected while the function words are displayed, no change will occur. When the content graph is opened again, the filter will be applied.)
            </p>
            <h3>Changing Datasets</h3>
            <p>
                Each Bubble Chart is created from data for a single speaker from the Book of Mormon text. The sidebar on the right contains the name of 
                each speaker. In order to view the charts for a specific person, the user can click on the name and the graphs will automatically be redrawn.
                The currently selected dataset/speaker will be highlighted in bold text for clarity.
            </p>
            <h3>Bubble Interaction</h3>
            <p>While viewing a graph, the user has a few options for interacting with the graph. If a bubble is hovered with the cursor, the exact 
                frequency value of the word (how many times it appears in the text) will be displayed. <br>
                If a bubble is clicked, the graph will "zoom-in" on the selected bubble, revealing more information such as a quote from the speaker where the word is used. 
                This mode can be exited by clicking the back button which appears just below the bubble.
